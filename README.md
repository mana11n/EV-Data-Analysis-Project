# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis – Tableau Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard built to analyze electric vehicle (EV) population data across the United States. The analysis focuses on adoption trends over time, vehicle type distribution (BEV vs PHEV), manufacturer dominance, geographic spread by state, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.

The goal of this project is to explore large-scale structured data and communicate insights effectively through interactive visualizations.
