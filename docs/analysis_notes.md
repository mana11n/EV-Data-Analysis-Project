# Analysis Notes

## Objective
The objective of this analysis was to explore electric vehicle (EV) population data and identify key adoption trends using interactive visualizations.

## Key Observations
- EV adoption has increased significantly in recent model years
- Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) dominate total registrations compared to PHEVs
- EV distribution is geographically concentrated in specific states
- Manufacturer dominance is led primarily by Tesla
- CAFV eligibility highlights the role of policy incentives in EV adoption

## Approach
- Used Tableau to create KPI cards, trend lines, bar charts, and geographic maps
- Applied filters for EV type, state, model year, and CAFV eligibility
- Focused on clarity and interpretability of insights rather than predictive modeling
